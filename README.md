## Fast Follows Before Mainnet Launch

### Building A Gasless DApp for users  
We would imagine that your first thought after learning about a platform with onboarding users through a Learn2Earn model was what about the gas fees? We weren't able to cram this into the scope of the hackathon, but we are doing a fast follow on this for a mainnet launch. We are currently working on incorparating GSN(Gas Station Network), to create a gasless experience for our users. This is a major drawback to our platform currently and definitely serves as our top priority. 

### Level 1 Mobile App 
While our platform is catered towards people already in Web3, we recognize that a huge userbase is being left out by not having a mobile component for a platform like this. Our current UI does transfer well to the MetaMask mobile app, however native mobile applications will allow us to leverage a better user experience for users.  

### Gating Discords Through Our Level 1 NFT 
What if we could have DAOs gate their discords by requiring new members to have our Level 1 NFT ðŸ¤”

## Level 1 Token 
We know, we know. *Another* cryptocurrency ðŸ™„, the last thing we want to is make this a moonshot project!(add reasons for level 1 token)

## Level 1 NFT  
The Level 1 NFT simply serves as a point of reference for users to have showing proof of having finished a particular course on website. We hope to leverage this by gating discord communities, creating incentive to participate in more courses on the platform through awards from nft ownership, and creating a community amongst Level 1 users.
